# solar-system
Whilst playing around with SASS an accident occured where list-item discs started rotating around a central element. This inspired me to map out the Solar System... Both planets and their moons have individual orbits - the Sun is 10 times smaller though (for obvious reasons)!

Work can be done - some number-crunching to get sizes, distances and speeds accurate.

The background text information is pulled in from the Wikipedia API via JSON; I will use this wonderful resource to change the text based on clicking of different celestial bodies.

The star background I'll happily admit I found here:
