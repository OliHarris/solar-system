# solar-system

Try it out! Code updated...

:heavy_check_mark: Code in pure React / TypeScript

:heavy_check_mark: Removed jQuery

## Old Notes...

Whilst playing around with SASS an accident occured where list-item discs started rotating around a central element. This inspired me to map out the Solar System... Both planets and their moons have individual orbits - the Sun is 10 times smaller though (for obvious reasons)!

Work can be done - some number-crunching to get sizes, distances and speeds accurate.

The background text information is pulled in from the Wikipedia API via JSON; I will use this wonderful resource to change the text based on clicking of different celestial bodies.

The star background I'll happily admit I found here:

## Available Scripts

In the root directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run start`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

### `npm run build`

Will perform a usual package of the build folder, ready for deployment.

## NOTE:

As this is a Vite app, I hosted it on GitHub pages using this guide:
